## Hi there 👋 I'm Ouissal


I'm currently learning and growing in programming.  
Right now, I'm:
- Studying core web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) using **W3Schools**
- Working on **certifications** to strengthen my skills
- Building **simple projects** to practice what I learn (step by step)

### What I'm focusing on
- Clean code basics
- Small real-world projects
- Consistency: learn → practice → improve

📌 Follow my progress here — I’ll keep updating this repo with new exercises and mini-projects.
